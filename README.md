# Toy Sales Analysis
Created a Dynamic Power BI Dashboard which focuses on Revenue generated across all stores and cities.
1. Need a switchable Top N to see which products are doing well and compare the selected productto the overall revenue.
2. Revenue trend on a monthly basis.
3. Revenue comaprision across sales regions.
4. On one slicer I want to select both month and year to filter the dashboard.
5. A slicer for regions.
